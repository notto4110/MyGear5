ALWAYS RUN "autoupdate.exe" THAT WAY YOU WILL GET THE LATEST VERSION OF THE BOT DOWNlOADED TO YOUR PC

Authenication Steps: inside the file settings.ini, put your secret key in `secret_key`, 
you can receive your secret key by messaging the bot "Gear 5"
with -getkey (without the quotes), second you must whitelist your HWID,
to get your HWID, run "Gear_5.exe" for the first time, and it'll give you your HWID, next
send the bot -changehwid and your HWID. For example, if my HWID was "109i3kad" then, 
I would message the bot "-changehwid 109i3kad", next to whitelist your Roblox UserId, you message the
the bot with -changeid if my Roblox UserId was "10389234" then I would message the bot "-changeid 10389234"
